# Loading data from JSON files

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. JSON files are easy for humans to read and write and at the same time also easy for machines to parse and generate. A lot of data are packaged as JSONs so it is important to learn how to load data in JSON format.
